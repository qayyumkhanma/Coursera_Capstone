# Accident Severity Prediction

> Applied Data Science Capstone Project

### Business Problem
The key objective of this project is to predict the severity of accidents in the Seattle area using the historical data provided by the Seattle Police Department (SPD). Road accidents are a major problem causing thousands of deaths and even greater number of injuries each year. They also cause significant amount of property damage. They are especially common in densely populated urban cities. Due to the rapid urbanization, the rate of road traffic accidents has been continually increasing each year. There are several reasons which contribute towards accidents such as conditions of roads, weather conditions, traffic situations etc. By performing machine learning, we try to predict the severity of road accidents which will help us identify the major contributing factors behind them. This information can then be used by the authorities to take appropriate preventive measures that will reduce the risk of accidents. Individual commuters can also utilize this information to plan their travel accordingly.
